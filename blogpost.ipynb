    "## Introduction: Basic Idea of Option Pricing\n",
    "\n",
    "Option is a financial contract that give the buyer the right to buy or sell certain quantity of assets as specific strike price on or before maturity date, and the buyer needs to pay premium or \"option price\" in this context to the seller of this contract. Option pricing is a way to evaluate the fair value of an option which corresponds to its striking price, maturity time and risk involved with the stock. Traditionally, traders use models like Black-Scholes model to estimate the price of an option, but these models have their limitations and base assumptions that are not certainly sound. With the power of machine learning, we are deriving a model that will evaluate the fair value of an option based on current stock price, quality, greeks of the stock, implied volatility of the stock. We will utilize pytorch to deploy a machine learning model to fit from past option price data for the S&P 500 index. "

    "For the first step of our project is acquiring the data. We found a dataset [link] on kaggle, and traced to the source which is optiondx[link]. This websites contains a text based datasets with end of date data for free. The following is the features. Then, realizing we might need real time stock price data for target, we utilize a package called yfinance which calls yahoo finance's unofficial api to download data from a time range by `yf.download` function, which gets us an adjusted closed data at the end of each trading date.
